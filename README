Arduino library for Dallas Semiconductor DS1305 real time clock

This library provides support for integration of the DS1305 real time clock with Arduino (or equivalent) using the SPI bus.

Everything appears working at this time, although testing is not complete. Full test program and examples will be coming in the near future
