Arduino library for Dallas Semiconductor DS1305 real time clock

This library provides support for integration of the DS1305 real time clock with Arduino (or equivalent) using the SPI bus.

Bug fixes from testing have been incorporated. All functions now appear to be working properly. Will be adding test script and examples shortly.
